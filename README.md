   import socket
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
   s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80))
   print(s.getsockname()[0])

### 2. **Upload Ground Truth**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For the current submission, the ground truth has already been added to the database. You can always reset the program and upload manually if you want to test.

To upload the ground truth, follow these steps:
1. Prepare a **zip file** containing one image (not I-Card image) of each student in **.jpg**. The **filename** should be the student's **roll number** (e.g., `12345.jpg`).

2. The images should **not be in any subdirectories**.
3. On the home page, if the ground truth has not yet been uploaded, you will be prompted to upload the zip file.

4. Select the zip file and click **Save Changes**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: During this time, to avoid data consistency issues, you won't be able to add a class or reset the program at this time. The processing of the ground truth will take approximately 5 minutes. Once completed, the respective buttons will be re-enabled after you refresh the page.
