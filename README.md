   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To get your IPv4 address in Python:
   ```python
   import socket
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
   s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80))
   print(s.getsockname()[0])

### 2. **Upload Ground Truth**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For the current submission, the ground truth has already been added to the database. You can always click on `reset` button on the homepage and upload from your end if you want to test.

To upload the ground truth, follow these steps:
1. Prepare a **zip file** containing one image (not I-Card image) of each student in **.jpg**. The **filename** should be the student's **roll number** (e.g., `12345.jpg`).

2. The images should **not be in any subdirectories**.
3. On the home page, if the ground truth has not yet been uploaded, you will be prompted to upload the zip file.
